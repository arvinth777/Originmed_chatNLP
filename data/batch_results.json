        "anonymized_text": "Patient: Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (genetic) when I was 12. Over the past five years, I have become around 50 pounds overweight and all of my attempts to lose have seemed to fail so I have given up, but my weight has stayed the same. There is so much information put there about losing weight with hypothyroidism but it all seems to conflict. I am so unsure as to what type of exercise and diet I should follow as a result but I still would like to lose weight, but most importantly have my body feel better. What can I do? I am currently on Levothyroxine, Buspar, and Benedryl.\n\nDoctor: Hi. You have really done well with the hypothyroidism problem. Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good. As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight. My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin. Everyday water intake should be around 1.5-2 liters. You can use flax seeds. Powder it and mix it in your food. It is a fiber which will give you fullness. Use turmeric, fenugreek seeds, or powder every day. It is a good antioxidant and fenugreek helps in reducing cholesterol levels. Include low-fat milk, curd every day. Egg white, lean chicken, or fish can be taken daily in moderation (anyone). Organ meats need to be avoided. Is your menstrual cycle normal? Please get back if you have any other complaints. Follow up after 15 days.",

I thought it would disappear once I went back home, but it only got worse. I did some research and assumed that it was caused by drinking too much cow's milk, but it has been since since I stopped and they would still not go away.

I hope you can help me because it has been affecting my mental state lately :((((\n\nDoctor: Hi there Acne has multifactorial etiology. Only acne soap does not improve if ypu have grade 2 or more grade acne. You need to have oral and topical medications. This before writing medicines i need to confirm your grade of acne.

It seems to get stiff, and my bones pop a lot around there, and it is very uncomfortable to sit in specific ways feels like my bones shift, well the other night it seemed as if my shoulder would pop out of place causing more stiffness after a while of dealing with it. I ended up feeling a popping sensation, where the stiffness was an instant relief. It was so shocking it put my anxiety through the roof. I thought I was going to die because my whole body was shaking and tingling. What am I dealing with? Right now I have no pain or tender near that area still relief but curious on what happened and why I got this shock and that popping feeling so loud it scared me half to death.\n\nDoctor: Hello. The popping and discomfort what you felt is either because of improper scapulothoracic mobility or may be due to facet joint irritation in the neck with intervertebral hypermobility. Which could have caused due to stiffness in the chest muscles, shoulder stiffness, etc. I would recommend you to do a lot of icing in the chest and back muscles. Maintain your neck and upper back posture by doing some back retraction work. Gently stretch your neck and chest. Gently massage your chest and shoulders to relieve tension in the muscles. I hope this is helpful for now. Kindly revert in case you need any help in this regard.",

I did not eject, and I am sure that she did not eject as well (not 100 % sure). Do not know if the condom broke (as it was dark) but had some liquid on my penis (maybe fluid in condom, not sure) After few days from then I had cold followed by itchy skin. I took medicine from the doctor and got it resolved.After a few weeks from then, I had fever 100 F, mild night sweats, mild sore throat, slight weight loss (around four to five kg). Also I feel tired most of times. After 50 days, I got an HIV blood test, which came out negative. Do not know the name of the test, they took blood from my fingertip, tested it using some chemical for 40 minutes, and gave a report. Doctor suggested me get the same test after three months. Now I took medicines for flu symptoms which are giving me relief. But, very worried about the situation. Will medicine I used for cold and itchy skin have impact on HIV. Was the test enough for diagnosis as I do not know the name like fourth-generation etc. Also I washed my penis after 20 minutes with water thoroughly. Please help.\n\nDoctor: Hello. The HIV test uses a finger prick blood sample, with results given within 20 minutes, and is 99 % accurate at detecting any HIV exposure that may have occurred more than 12 weeks ago. However, it can potentially pick up HIV infection from as little as four weeks ago. There is nothing to worry nothing will happen, and please repeat your test after 12 weeks. If you want accurate results to get, it has done RNA PCR which will give actual results within 10days. Antigen detection like P24 gives best results with in two to four weeks. Probably your suffering from a simple viral upper respiratory infection. After 12 weeks, please consult your doctor he will examine and treat you accordingly.",
